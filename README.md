# Introduction to programming in JavaScript
> Important information

Please read the following guidelines before doing the exercises.

## How do I begin?

1. [*Fork*](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repository containing exercises.
2. Clone the repository onto your computer using the command: `git clone repository_address`.
You will find the address of the repository by pressing "Clone or download" button on its webpage.
3. Complete the exercises and commit changes to your repository using the commands below.
`git add filename` will add a single file which you have changed.
If you want to add all the changed files at once, use `git add .`.
Remember that the fullstop (dot) at the end of this command is important!
Next, commit changes using `git commit -m "description_of_changes"`.
4. Push changes to your repository on GitHub by typing: `git push origin master`.
5. Create a [*pull request*](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to the original repository when you have finished all the exercises.

## Contents of this repository

* 1_Exercises
    * Here you will find tasks related to the classes. A few at the beginning are for the lecturer to show you how to solve the next ones. Complete them during class. Your mentor will not check them, but if in doubt during the exam, he may take a look at them. Upload them systematically on github.

* 2_Snippets
    * Here you will find pieces of code that solve various problems. You may find them useful when doing exercises.

* 3_Homework
    * Complete them at home on your own. They will be checked by your mentor. Remember to write the code for each exercise in a function so that it returns the values described in the exercise. Non-obligatory exercises (marked with * ) are for the eager and ambitious students - just like yourself, right? :). Do as many as you can. You can upload them any time. Ask your mentor about the deadline to complete the basic set of exercises.

Do the exercises in appropriate files.
