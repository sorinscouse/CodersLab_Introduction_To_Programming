## Exercises done with the lecturer

### Drawing a number  (~ 5min - 10 min)

Draw a number from the range 1 - 100 and save it in a variable. Then, check with a conditional statement if the number is greater than 50. If so, write "Hooray" in the console; otherwise, write "number less than 50".

### Korzystanie z prompt (~ 5min - 10 min)

Using `prompt()` method, extract the answer to the question "How old are you?" from the user. If the user is adult - write the information "You are adult" in the console; if under 18 - write "You are under age".

## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 1 (~ 5min - 10 min)
Create variables ```a``` and ```b```. Assign numerical values to both of them. Then, using a conditional statement, write in the console which one of them is greater.

### Exercise 2 (~ 10min - 15 min)
Draw a number from the range 1 - 10 and save it in a variable. Using the `prompt()` method, ask the user to enter a numberin the range 1 - 10. If the entered number is equal to the drawn one - write "Good job!" in the console, if not - "Try again!".

### Exercise 3 (~ 10min - 15 min)
Some people believe that a year of human life equals seven years of dog life.
Create a ```menAge``` variable and set its value to 30. Create a ```pet``` value storing the name of a pet, e.g. "dog" or "cat".

Then, using known conditional expression, check which pet the user chose and if it is a dog, calculate how old the dog would be if it were human.
