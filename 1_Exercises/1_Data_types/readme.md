#  Data types

> Remember to separate exercises with comments, and write legible, well-formatted code.

## Exercises done with the lecturer

### Data types  (~ 2min - 5min)

Create a ```numberOfUsers``` variable and assign any number to it. Now, create a ```result``` variable and assign to it the result of dividing```numberOfUsers``` by 2. Round the result down and write it in the console.

### Calculating root (~ 2min - 5min)

Calculate the root of 144. Write the result in the console.

### Metody dla stringów jak używać (~ 2min - 5min)

Create a ```postcode``` variable and assign your postal code to it as a string. Using string methods, check if the string contains a "-" character.

## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 1 (~ 5min - 10min)
- Create as many variables as you know variable types.
- Name each variable according to the type and assign appropriate data to it.
- Now, add different variables to each other and check the type of the result (use ```typeof```).
- Write the type of each variable in a comment next to it.
Write each variable in the console.
Note how data types change depending on the types that are added to each other. This is called implicit data conversion (JavaScript engine changes the data type without our contribution).
- See the example in exercise4.js and write analogical code.

### Exercise 2 (~ 5min - 10 min)

Create two variables and assign any numbers to them. Then write the quotient of these numbers (division result) in the console. Assign it to the  ```result``` variable.
Now, write in the console the ceiling and floor of the ```result``` variable.

### Exercise 3 (~ 5min - 10 min)

Draw a number from the range 5-100 and write it in the console.
Use the formula:

```JavaScript
 Math.random() * (max - min) + min
 ```

### Exercise 4 (~ 5min - 10 min)
Add the two variables: ```var widthBox = "23px";``` and  ```var widthPanel = "2px";``` and write the result in the console.

### Exercise 5  (~ 10min - 15 min)
Write any email in the ```mail``` variable. Then, using an appropriate string method, check if the email contains a "@" character.
