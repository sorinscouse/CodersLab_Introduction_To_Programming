#  Loops

> Remember to separate exercises with comments, and write legible, well-formatted code.

## Exercises done with the lecturer

### Factorial (~ 7min - 12min)

Write a program that will calculate the value of **x!** where **!** means factorial, and **x** is a variable.
Use both known loops.
Factorial is the result of multiplicating every integer from 1 to the given value:

```JavaScript
5! = 1*2*3*4*5 = 120
8! = 1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8 = 40320
```
### Drawing in the console  (~ 7min - 12min)

Write a program drawing the following scheme based on the value of **n** (here you see it for ```n = 5```):

```  
* * * * *
*       *
*       *
*       *
* * * * *  
```

To complete the exercise, create a **result** variable to which you will add stars (`*`), empty spaces (` `), or new line signs (`\n`).
Do the exercise using the for and while loops.

## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 1 (~ 10min - 15 min)

Write a program that will write all numbers from 0 to **n**, based on the value of **n**.
The program should also write next to each number whether it is even or odd. E.g.:

```JavaScript
0 – even
1 – odd
2 – even
3 – odd
...
```

### Exercise 2 (~ 10min - 15 min)
Write a program that counts the sum of all numbers in the given range from **x** to **y**.
Use know loops.
E.g. for ```x = 5```, ```y = 10``` the sum will be ```5+6+7+8+9+10=45```.


### Exercise 3 (~ 15min - 20 min)

Write a program drawing the following scheme based on the value of **n** (here you see it for ```n = 5```):

```  
  *   *
*   *   *
  *   *  
*   *   *
  *   *   
```
Use nested loops and add an **if** statement to the inner loop to check the appropriate condition (if ```i + j``` is odd, a star should be added). Create a **result** variable and add stars to it to which you will add stars (`*`), empty spaces (` `), or new line signs (`\n`).
